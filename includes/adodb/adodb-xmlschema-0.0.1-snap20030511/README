Thanks to John Lim for giving us ADODB, and for the hard work that keeps it on top of things. 
And particulary for the datadict code that made xmlschema possible.
And to the kind folks at PHP Documentor. Cool tool.
And to Linus. I thought the end of Amiga was the end of computing. Guess I was wrong :-)
